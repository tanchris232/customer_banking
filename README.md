# customer_banking

## Overview of the assignment 
- We we're asked to create a banking system that allows user to track their savings and cd accounts with interest eanred. It will take in their current savings and cd balances then get the interest earned on those balances and and then add that back into the balance.
- All 4 of my files are located in this repo and you are to run customer_banking.py to see the program. 
- This is my resubmission - I'm not sure if you're able to reference my old submission. I went back to look at it after I submitted and it clicked. In the updated_savings_account variable I was adding savings_account which is account and I should have been adding balance and interest_earned. This code works fine now and I am getting the correct results. 

Thank you!
