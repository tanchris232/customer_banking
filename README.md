# customer_banking

## Overview of the assignment 
- We we're asked to create a banking system that allows user to track their savings and cd accounts with interest eanred. It will take in their current savings and cd balances then get the interest earned on those balances and and then add that back into the balance.
- All 4 of my files are located in this repo and you are to run customer_banking.py to see the program. 
- I have this finished according to the project requirements but unfortunately could not get it to work. I know that the error is occuring when I am calculating the interest earned - I cannot add 'Account' and 'float'. I have tried many ways to resolve this. I'm certain that the rest of the code will work when this error has been resolved. I plan to resubmit if I can get the program working.

Thank you!
